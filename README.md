# setout

setout is a string formatting function for Python that closely resembles
[Common Lisp's `format`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_c.htm)

This was written by [Peter
Seibel](https://github.com/gigamonkey/python-format). I have merely
stuck it in a python egg so that I can install it in projects, and
renamed it from `format` to `setout` so as to not cause confusion with
the python built-in of the same name.

Of his creation, Mr. Seibel writes:

> _Yet is it far better to light the candle than to curse the darkness._

> One evening I was about to Tweet something snarky about why is it
that none of these modern, so-called batteries-included languages
included anything like as rich functionality for outputting text as
good old Common Lisp `FORMAT`.

> Then I realized that I could fix that. Thus this library.
